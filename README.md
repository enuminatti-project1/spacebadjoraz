## Instructions to play

  W           Up 
A   D    Left    Right
  S          Down

There's only one player but both sets of conventional movement keys can be used simultaneously.

SPACE shoots a series of bullets up to 5 in a row.

There's 5 "levels"/"bosses" to clear to clear the game.

Level/Boss 1: Filipe with low health and low hit damage
Level/Boss 2: Pedro  with a bit more health and double hit damage
Level/Boss 3: Jorge  with medium health and triple hit damage
Level/Boss 4: Catarina with high health and high hit damage
Final Boss  : Ferrão, the god of programming, health sponge and hits like a truck
